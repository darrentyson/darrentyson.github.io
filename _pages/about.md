Just getting started with this, so bear with me as I slowly add more info...

My personal website with a focus on what I do
======
It's hard for me to separate work and play because work for me is so enjoyable——I love what I do. I am research faculty at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu) where I conduct [cancer systems biology](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/dcb/research-programs/csbc/cancer-systems-biology-consortium) and pharmacology research and education. My official training was as an experimental biologist at the cell and molecular level, and I obtained my Ph.D. studying transcription factors and their rapid activation by extracellular signals from [Saint Louis University](https://www.slu.edu) under the tutelage of [Nicola Partridge](https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/nicola-c-partridge). 

Recreation
------
Cycling is a particular passion, especially mountain biking, but I'll ride anything with two wheels. I enjoy most music genres but have a special place in my heart for alternative and punk.

Family
------
I'm currently in my 29th year of marriage to my amazing wife, and my son is working hard studying computer engineering in college.

Guinness is manna.
